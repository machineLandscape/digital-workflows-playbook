# CAD Technique — Lineweights & Graphic Hierarchy

**Use when:** everything looks the same weight or drawings feel flat.

---

## Core idea

Lineweight communicates importance before color.

Fewer lineweights = clearer drawings.

---

## Typical hierarchy

- Cut lines — heaviest
- Primary edges — medium
- Secondary context — light
- Reference / background — very light

---

## Best practices

- Limit yourself to 4–5 lineweights
- Assign by layer, not object
- Test in PDF, not on screen

---

## Common mistake

Relying on color instead of hierarchy.
