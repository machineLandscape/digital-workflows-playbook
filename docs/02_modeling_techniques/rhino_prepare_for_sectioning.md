# Rhino Technique — Prepare Terrain Surfaces for Sectioning
**Version:** v1.1  
**Tool:** Rhino  
**Scope:** Pre-section cleanup  

---

## 1. When to use this

Use this guide when:
- Section curves fail
- Sections look jagged
- Drafted sections feel unstable

Do this **before** exporting to CAD.

---

## 2. Core idea

**Sections reveal surface problems immediately.**

If sections fail, the surface is not ready.

---

## 3. Step 1 — Simplify the surface

- Avoid unnecessary detail
- Remove micro-variation
- Prefer smooth continuity

Heavy surfaces cause unreliable sections.

---

## 4. Step 2 — Check surface continuity

Look for:
- Multiple joined surfaces
- Seams
- Trimmed edges

If possible, use one continuous surface.

---

## 5. Step 3 — Test sections early

- Cut multiple test sections
- Vary direction
- Inspect curvature

Do not wait until drafting.

---

## 6. Step 4 — Lock a clean copy

Once working:
- Duplicate the surface
- Lock one version
- Use the other for experimentation

Never risk the clean base surface.

---

## 7. Common failures

❌ Jagged sections → surface too dense  
❌ Missing segments → surface breaks  
❌ Inconsistent profiles → upstream issues  

Fix before export.

---

## 8. Checkpoint

You should have:
- Smooth section curves
- Predictable results
- Confidence exporting

If not, return upstream.
