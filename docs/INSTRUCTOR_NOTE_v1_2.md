# Instructor Note — Playbook v1.2

This playbook replaces live software demonstrations with:
- structured workflows
- optional step-by-step technique guides
- asynchronous reinforcement via curated videos

Class time is intentionally reserved for:
- conceptual framing
- critique
- troubleshooting
- design discussion

Students are expected to consult technique guides independently
before requesting procedural help.

v1.2 is a frozen release. Changes should increment the version.
