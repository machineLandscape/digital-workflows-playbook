## 1. What this does

This guide shows how to use **Photoshop intentionally** to improve the clarity and hierarchy of plans and sections.

---

## 2. When to use this

Use this guide:
- After drafting and scaling are complete
- Before final boards or pin-ups
- When drawings need emphasis

---

## 3. Core idea (read this)

**Clarity beats realism.**

Use Photoshop to support drawings, not overpower them.

---

## 4. Typical Photoshop uses

- Poché
- Shadows
- Textures
- Highlighting key elements

Avoid photo-real rendering unless required.

---

## 5. Layer discipline

- Name layers clearly
- Group related effects
- Keep base drawing locked

---

## 6. Maintain consistency

- Use limited color palettes
- Keep graphic language consistent
- Match plan and section styles

---

## 7. Checkpoint

You should have:
- Clear hierarchy
- Readable drawings
- Files ready for layout

---

## 8. What to do next

- Assemble layouts:  
  → InDesign guides (coming soon)

- If clarity suffers:  
  → [CAD → Illustrator: Linework for Graphics](../05_translation/guide_xlate_03_cad_to_illustrator.md)

Photoshop should clarify, not decorate.
