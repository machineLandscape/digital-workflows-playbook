## 1. What this does

This guide explains how to set up **scaled drawings, annotation, and viewports** in CAD so drawings print correctly and consistently.

---

## 2. When to use this

Use this guide:
- Before plotting PDFs
- When drawings print at the wrong scale
- When annotation looks inconsistent

---

## 3. Core idea (read this)

**Model space is real size. Paper space is representation.**

Never mix the two.

---

## 4. Set annotation scale

- Decide drawing scale first
- Set annotation scale accordingly
- Keep text readable at print size

---

## 5. Use viewports correctly

- Create viewports in paper space
- Lock viewports
- Assign one scale per viewport

Do not resize viewports arbitrarily.

---

## 6. Common annotation elements

Include:
- Labels
- Dimensions
- Scale bars
- North arrows

Keep them consistent.

---

## 7. Verify before export

Always:
- Preview print
- Check scale bar
- Confirm lineweights

---

## 8. Checkpoint

You should be able to:
- Plot at correct scale
- Read drawings clearly
- Reuse layouts

---

## 9. What to do next

- Export PDFs:  
  → CAD export guide (coming soon)

- Graphic refinement:  
  → [CAD → Illustrator: Linework for Graphics](../05_translation/guide_xlate_03_cad_to_illustrator.md)

Correct scale is non-negotiable.
