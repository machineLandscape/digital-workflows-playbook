# GUIDE_CAD_03 — Organize Layers for a Site Plan

**Version:** v01.0  
**Audience:** Mixed ability  
**Last updated:** 2025-12-20  
**Primary workflow:** Drafting  
**Does not cover:** Advanced annotation standards or construction documentation

## 1. What this does

This guide shows you how to set up a **clear, logical layer structure** in CAD so your site plans are readable, editable, and easy to export.

Layers are **drawing logic**, not just organization.

---

## 2. When to use this

Use this guide:
- Before drafting a site plan
- When a file feels cluttered or fragile
- Before exporting drawings

---

## 3. Core idea (read this)

**Layers communicate intent.**

If layers are unclear:
- Editing becomes risky
- Graphics become inconsistent
- Exports break

---

## 4. Recommended layer groups

Typical high-level groups:
- Site boundary
- Circulation
- Buildings
- Topography
- Vegetation
- Water
- Annotation

Do not overcomplicate this.

---

## 5. Naming conventions

Use consistent, readable names:
```
SITE_boundary
CIRC_roads
TOPO_contours
VEG_tree_canopy
TEXT_labels
```

Avoid vague names like:
- Layer1
- Misc
- Test

---

## 6. Assign geometry intentionally

Every object should:
- Live on one layer
- Have a clear role
- Be easy to isolate

Never draft on layer 0.

---

## 7. Control visibility

Use layers to:
- Turn information on/off
- Create drawing variations
- Simplify exports

This is the power of CAD.

---

## 8. Checkpoint

You should be able to:
- Isolate key systems
- Export clean drawings
- Understand the file months later

---

## 9. What to do next

- Export drawings:  
  → CAD export guide (coming soon)

- Refine graphics:  
  → CAD → Illustrator (XLATE_03)

Clean layers make clean drawings.
