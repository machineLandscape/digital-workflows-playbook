## 1. What this does

This guide shows how to use **InDesign as a layout tool** for assembling drawings, diagrams, and text into clear presentation boards.

InDesign is about **structure and consistency**, not graphics.

---

## 2. When to use this

Use this guide:
- After drawings are graphically resolved
- Before pin-up or final review
- When boards feel messy or inconsistent

---

## 3. Core idea (read this)

**InDesign controls relationships.**

It aligns, scales, and organizes content across pages.

---

## 4. File setup

- Set page size intentionally
- Use margins and columns
- Establish baseline grids if helpful

Do this before placing content.

---

## 5. Place drawings correctly

- Use *Place*, not copy-paste
- Link files, don’t embed
- Keep scale consistent

Let other software do the drawing.

---

## 6. Text and labels

- Use paragraph styles
- Keep fonts limited
- Maintain hierarchy

Typography should disappear.

---

## 7. Export boards

- Export high-quality PDF
- Check resolution and color
- Review before submission

---

## 8. Checkpoint

You should have:
- Clean, aligned boards
- Consistent scale and type
- Files ready for print or screen

InDesign is the glue, not the content.
