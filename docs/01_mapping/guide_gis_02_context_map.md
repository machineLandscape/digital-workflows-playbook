## 1. What this does

This guide shows you how to create a **clear, legible GIS context map** suitable for design work and downstream translation into CAD and modeling tools.

This is not an analysis map.  
This is a **working base map**.

---

## 2. When to use this

Use this guide:
- After gathering site data
- Before modeling or drafting
- When you need geographic context

---

## 3. Core idea (read this)

A context map answers three questions:
1. Where is the site?
2. What surrounds it?
3. What matters at this scale?

Everything else is noise.

---

## 4. Set up the GIS project

- Set project CRS intentionally
- Load only relevant layers
- Group layers logically

Name things clearly.

---

## 5. Clip to a meaningful extent

Do not map the whole county.

- Clip to site + surroundings
- Include major infrastructure
- Include natural systems

Context ≠ everything.

---

## 6. Simplify before styling

Before worrying about appearance:
- Remove unnecessary attributes
- Simplify geometry if needed
- Turn off layers you don’t need

Clean data makes clean maps.

---

## 7. Style for clarity (not beauty)

- Thin lines
- Limited colors
- Clear hierarchy
- No decorative effects

This map is a tool, not a poster.

---

## 8. Export correctly

- Export to PDF for review
- Export to DXF/DWG for CAD
- Keep scale consistent

Do not rasterize unless necessary.

---

## 9. Checkpoint

You should have:
- A readable context map
- Clean layers
- Data ready for translation

If not, fix it now.

---

## 10. What to do next

- Move to drafting:  
  → [GIS → CAD: What Transfers and What Doesn’t](../05_translation/guide_xlate_01_gis_to_cad.md)

- If things break:  
  → [Troubleshoot When Something Goes Wrong](../00_getting_started/guide_00_03_troubleshoot.md)

Context maps are infrastructure, not decoration.
