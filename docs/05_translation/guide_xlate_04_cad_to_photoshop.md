## 1. What this does

This guide explains how to move drawings from CAD into Photoshop for **raster-based graphic effects**.

Photoshop is for **tone, texture, and atmosphere**, not drafting.

---

## 2. When to use this

Use this guide:
- After drafting is complete
- When adding shadows, textures, or gradients
- When drawings feel flat

---

## 3. Core idea (read this)

**Photoshop adds depth, not accuracy.**

Never fix drafting problems in Photoshop.

---

## 4. Export from CAD

Preferred method:
- Export PDF or high-resolution image
- Keep scale consistent

---

## 5. Set up Photoshop file

- Use layers intentionally
- Keep original drawing untouched
- Work non-destructively

---

## 6. Add effects sparingly

Common uses:
- Shadows
- Ground textures
- Water effects

Avoid over-rendering.

---

## 7. Checkpoint

You should have:
- Enhanced legibility
- Preserved scale
- Editable layers

---

## 8. What to do next

- Assemble boards:  
  → InDesign guides (coming soon)

Photoshop is seasoning, not the meal.
