# GUIDE_XLATE_03 — CAD → Illustrator: Linework for Graphics

**Version:** v01.0  
**Audience:** Mixed ability  
**Last updated:** 2025-12-20  
**Primary workflow:** Drafting → Representation  
**Does not cover:** Photoshop workflows or final layout

---

## 1. What this does

This guide explains how to move **clean CAD linework** into Illustrator for graphic refinement.

The goal is **graphic clarity**, not drafting precision.

---

## 2. When to use this

Use this guide:
- After drafting is complete
- Before final graphics or layout
- When CAD visuals feel rigid

---

## 3. Core idea (read this)

**CAD draws accurately. Illustrator draws clearly.**

Do not redraw what CAD already did well.

---

## 4. Prepare the CAD file

Before export:
- Clean layers
- Remove unused objects
- Set lineweights intentionally

What you export matters.

---

## 5. Export workflow

Preferred method:
- Export PDF from CAD
- Import PDF into Illustrator

Avoid DXF unless necessary.

---

## 6. Organize in Illustrator

Immediately:
- Group by layer
- Rename groups
- Lock reference geometry

Maintain structure.

---

## 7. Graphic refinement

Use Illustrator for:
- Lineweight hierarchy
- Color
- Hatches
- Symbols

Not for scaling or precision.

---

## 8. Checkpoint

You should have:
- Editable vector graphics
- Clear hierarchy
- A file ready for layout

---

## 9. What to do next

- Add raster effects:  
  → Photoshop guides (coming soon)

- Assemble boards:  
  → InDesign guides (coming soon)

CAD → Illustrator is about **clarity**, not control.
