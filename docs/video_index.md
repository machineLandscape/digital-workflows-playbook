## Important warnings

Many tutorials:
- skip viewport scale setup
- hide poor defaults
- compensate instead of fixing upstream problems

Always verify:
- viewport scale
- page setup scale = 1:1
- layer visibility and plot settings

- remove any that promote bad habits

Replace links deliberately; do not let this list grow unchecked.
