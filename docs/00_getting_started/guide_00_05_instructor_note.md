## Purpose of this note

This note explains **what parts of traditional software instruction this playbook replaces**, and how instructors can reallocate class time more productively.

This is not a teaching philosophy statement.  
It is an **operational guide** for running studio with the playbook in place.

---

## What this playbook replaces

The playbook fully replaces the need for:

### 1. Live software demonstrations
Including:
- “Watch me click” sessions
- Step-by-step projection demos
- Repeated explanations for students who missed class

Students now:
- Reference guides asynchronously
- Revisit steps as needed
- Self-diagnose workflow problems

---

### 2. Linear software lectures
Including:
- Week-by-week tool progression
- Forced sequencing (“you must learn X before Y”)
- Catch-up sessions

The playbook is intentionally **non-linear**.

---

### 3. Tool-based grading
Including:
- Assessing whether a student used the “right” software
- Penalizing alternate workflows
- Grading technical polish over design intent

The focus shifts to **design clarity and communication**.

---

## What still belongs in class

Class time should now prioritize:

### 1. Design critique
- Conceptual intent
- Spatial logic
- Representation choices

Students arrive with work already produced.

---

### 2. Workflow diagnosis (not instruction)
Instead of teaching tools, instructors:
- Identify where a workflow broke
- Point students to the correct guide
- Reinforce boundaries between tools

This builds long-term independence.

---

### 3. Decision-making discussions
For example:
- Why use an axon instead of a section?
- When does rendering help vs. obscure?
- What level of detail is appropriate now?

These are *design* questions, not software questions.

---

## How to assign the playbook

Recommended language:

> “Use the Digital Workflows Playbook whenever you’re stuck.  
> I will not reteach software steps in class.”

This sets expectations clearly.

---

## How to intervene when students struggle

When a student asks:
> “How do I do this?”

Respond with:
1. Identify the workflow stage
2. Identify the tool boundary
3. Point to the relevant guide

Avoid:
- Reopening software
- Re-demonstrating steps
- Fixing files for them

---

## Why this improves studio outcomes

Instructors gain:
- More time for critique
- Fewer repetitive questions
- Clearer assessment of design thinking

Students gain:
- Independence
- Transferable skills
- Confidence navigating tools

---

## Final note

This playbook is **infrastructure**, not curriculum.

Once it is in place:
- Studio becomes about design again
- Software becomes a support system
- Missed classes no longer derail progress

That is the goal.
