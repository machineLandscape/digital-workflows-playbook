## 1. What this does

This guide shows you how to extract **sections and profiles** from a Rhino terrain model for use in drafting and analysis.

The goal is **accurate geometry**, not presentation graphics.

---

## 2. When to use this

Use this guide:
- After building a terrain model
- Before drafting sections or profiles
- When elevation change matters

---

## 3. Core idea (read this)

**Sections are analytical tools.**

They reveal slope, relationships, and constraints that plans hide.

---

## 4. Set up section lines

- Draw section lines intentionally
- Name them clearly
- Place them at meaningful locations

Do not cut random sections.

---

## 5. Generate sections

Common methods:
- Contour intersections
- Section plane cuts
- Curve extraction

Use the simplest reliable method.

---

## 6. Verify results

Check:
- Elevation accuracy
- Continuity
- Scale

Fix errors in the model, not the section.

---

## 7. Prepare for export

- Simplify curves
- Remove duplicates
- Organize by layer

Clean geometry exports cleanly.

---

## 8. Checkpoint

You should have:
- Accurate section curves
- Correct scale
- Geometry ready for CAD

---

## 9. What to do next

- Draft sections:  
  → CAD section guides (coming soon)

- Export geometry:  
  → [Rhino → CAD: Clean Geometry for Drafting](../05_translation/guide_xlate_02_rhino_to_cad.md)

Sections translate understanding into form.
