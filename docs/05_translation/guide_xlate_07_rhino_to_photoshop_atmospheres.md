# GUIDE_XLATE_07 — Rhino → Photoshop: Axon + Section Atmospheres

**Version:** v01.0  
**Audience:** Mixed ability  
**Last updated:** 2025-12-20  
**Primary workflow:** Modeling → Representation  
**Does not cover:** Photorealistic rendering or materials

## 1. What this does

This guide explains how to move **axonometric and section views from Rhino into Photoshop** to add atmosphere, depth, and emphasis.

The goal is **clarity and spatial legibility**, not realism.

---

## 2. When to use this

Use this guide:
- After modeling is complete
- When axons or sections feel flat
- When diagrams need depth or emphasis

If geometry is still changing, do not start here.

---

## 3. Core idea (read this)

**Rhino defines space. Photoshop defines mood.**

Never fix geometry or scale in Photoshop.

---

## 4. Prepare the Rhino view (critical)

Before export:
- Set the exact view (axon or section)
- Turn off unnecessary layers
- Use consistent display modes

Lock the view once it’s correct.

---

## 5. Export from Rhino

Preferred methods:
- Export view as high-resolution PNG
- Export vector linework separately if needed

Guidelines:
- Large resolution (300–600 dpi equivalent)
- Transparent background if possible

Expect to composite in Photoshop.

---

## 6. Set up the Photoshop file

In Photoshop:
- Place the Rhino export as a locked base layer
- Organize layers immediately
- Name layers clearly

Work non-destructively.

---

## 7. Add atmosphere deliberately

Common uses:
- Shadows to clarify depth
- Gradient washes for ground/sky
- Light overlays to guide focus

Use restraint.

---

## 8. Maintain hierarchy

Ensure:
- Primary geometry reads first
- Secondary elements recede
- Backgrounds stay quiet

If everything is loud, nothing reads.

---

## 9. Common failures & fixes

**Problem:** Image feels muddy  
**Fix:** Reduce opacity, simplify palette

**Problem:** Section reads flat  
**Fix:** Emphasize cut plane and shadows

**Problem:** File becomes unmanageable  
**Fix:** Group layers and label clearly

---

## 10. Checkpoint

You should have:
- Clear spatial depth
- Controlled atmosphere
- An image that supports design intent

---

## 11. What to do next

- Combine with vector graphics:  
  → Illustrator guides

- Assemble boards:  
  → InDesign guides

Rhino → Photoshop is about **atmosphere, not accuracy**.
