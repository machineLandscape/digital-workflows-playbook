# GUIDE_CAD_02 — Draft a GIS-Based Context Plan

**Version:** v01.0  
**Audience:** Mixed ability  
**Last updated:** 2025-12-20  
**Primary workflow:** Drafting  
**Input:** Clean GIS-derived geometry  
**Output:** Scaled, legible context plan drawing  
**Does not cover:** Detailed site design or construction documentation

---

## 1. What this does

This guide shows you how to turn **GIS-derived linework** into a **clear, conventional context plan** using CAD.

The goal is not to replicate the GIS map.  
The goal is to produce a **drafted drawing** that communicates context clearly.

---

## 2. When to use this

Use this guide:
- After completing GIS → CAD translation
- When preparing a context plan for review or pin-up
- Before adding site design or detailed annotation

---

## 3. Core idea (read this)

**Drafting is interpretation.**

CAD is where you:
- Decide what matters
- Establish hierarchy
- Remove noise

If everything looks the same, the drawing has failed.

---

## 4. Set up the CAD file

Before drawing anything:

- Confirm units and scale
- Set drawing limits intentionally
- Load or create a basic layer structure

Recommended base layers:
- Roads
- Parcels
- Buildings
- Water
- Vegetation
- Contours
- Text

---

## 5. Bring in GIS-derived geometry

- Insert or open the cleaned GIS export
- Do not explode everything immediately
- Lock reference layers if needed

Verify scale before proceeding.

---

## 6. Establish graphic hierarchy

This is the most important step.

Use:
- Lineweight differences
- Line types
- Selective emphasis

Rules of thumb:
- Roads > parcels
- Water > contours
- Site boundary > everything else

---

## 7. Redraw selectively (expected)

Do not hesitate to:
- Trace over messy lines
- Simplify geometry
- Replace GIS lines with clean CAD geometry

This is normal professional practice.

---

## 8. Add minimal annotation

Only add:
- Key labels
- North arrow
- Scale bar

Do not clutter the drawing.

---

## 9. Checkpoint

Your context plan should:
- Read clearly at pin-up distance
- Communicate location and surroundings
- Support later site drawings

If not, simplify again.

---

## 10. Common failures & fixes

**Problem:** Drawing looks busy  
**Fix:** Remove layers, reduce lineweights

**Problem:** Everything has same emphasis  
**Fix:** Rebuild hierarchy

**Problem:** Scale feels wrong  
**Fix:** Re-check base units

## 11. What to do next

- Export for review:  
  → CAD export guide (coming soon)

- Move into design:  
  → Modeling guides (Rhino)

- If things break:

A good context plan is quiet, clear, and intentional.
