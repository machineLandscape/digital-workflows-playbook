**Input:** Section curves from Rhino or CAD  
**Output:** Clear, readable section drawings

## 1. What this does

This guide shows how to turn **section geometry** into **communicative section drawings** using CAD.

Geometry alone is not a drawing.

---

## 2. When to use this

Use this guide:
- After cutting sections or profiles
- When preparing sections for review
- Before graphic refinement

---

## 3. Core idea (read this)

**Sections explain relationships.**

They must clearly show:
- Ground
- Structure
- Change over distance

---

## 4. Set up the section drawing

Before drafting:
- Confirm scale
- Set a horizontal datum
- Establish drawing limits

Consistency matters.

---

## 5. Establish hierarchy

Typical hierarchy:
- Cut line (heaviest)
- Ground plane
- Objects beyond
- Annotation

Make the cut obvious.

---

## 6. Poché and fills

Use poche:
- At cut surfaces
- Sparingly
- Consistently

Avoid over-filling.

---

## 7. Add minimal annotation

Include:
- Elevations
- Key labels
- Section title

Remove everything else.

---

## 8. Checkpoint

Your section should:
- Read instantly
- Explain slope and relationships
- Match plan graphics

---

## 9. What to do next

- Export for review:  
  → [Export a Clean, Scaled PDF](guide_cad_05_export_pdf.md)

- Graphic refinement:  
  → [CAD → Illustrator: Linework for Graphics](../05_translation/guide_xlate_03_cad_to_cad_to_illustrator.md)

Sections are analytical drawings first.
