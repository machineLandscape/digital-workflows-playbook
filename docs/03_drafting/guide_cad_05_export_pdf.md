## 1. What this does

This guide explains how to export **clean, correctly scaled PDFs** from CAD for review, printing, or further graphic work.

Most drawing problems at pin-up start here.

---

## 2. When to use this

Use this guide:
- After drafting and annotation are complete
- Before sending files to Illustrator or Photoshop
- Before printing or uploading PDFs

---

## 3. Core idea (read this)

**If the PDF is wrong, the drawing is wrong.**

Never assume exports are correct without checking.

---

## 4. Prepare before exporting

Before exporting:
- Confirm annotation scale
- Lock viewports
- Turn off unused layers
- Check lineweights

Do this every time.

---

## 5. Export workflow

Recommended method:
1. Plot from paper space
2. Use a standard PDF driver
3. Set scale explicitly
4. Use monochrome or grayscale styles as needed

Avoid screen captures.

---

## 6. Verify the PDF

After export:
- Measure a known distance
- Check text size
- Zoom in for line quality

Fix issues in CAD, not in Adobe.

---

## 7. Common failures & fixes

**Problem:** Scale is wrong  
**Fix:** Viewport not locked or wrong plot scale

**Problem:** Lines look faint  
**Fix:** Lineweight or plot style issue

**Problem:** Missing elements  
**Fix:** Layer visibility problem

## 8. Checkpoint

You should have:
- A PDF that prints correctly
- Consistent lineweights
- No surprises at pin-up

## 9. What to do next

- Graphic refinement:

- Raster effects:  
  → [CAD → Photoshop: Raster Effects](../05_translation/guide_xlate_04_cad_to_photoshop.md)

Exporting is part of drafting, not an afterthought.
