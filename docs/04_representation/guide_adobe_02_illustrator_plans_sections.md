## 1. What this does

This guide explains how to use **Illustrator intentionally** to refine plans and sections.

Illustrator is where hierarchy becomes legible.

---

## 2. When to use this

Use this guide:
- After exporting clean PDFs from CAD
- Before assembling final boards
- When drawings need clarity, not more detail

---

## 3. Core idea (read this)

**Illustrator is for hierarchy, not accuracy.**

Never fix scale or geometry here.

---

## 4. File setup

- Import PDFs, don’t place screenshots
- Keep scale intact
- Organize layers immediately

Structure first.

---

## 5. Lineweight system

Use Illustrator to:
- Refine hierarchy
- Clarify edges
- Emphasize important elements

Be consistent across drawings.

---

## 6. Color and tone

- Use limited palettes
- Avoid gradients unless intentional
- Keep backgrounds quiet

Less is more.

---

## 7. Symbols and patterns

Use:
- Trees
- Hatches
- Repeating elements

Avoid custom one-offs.

---

## 8. Checkpoint

You should have:
- Clear hierarchy
- Readable drawings
- Files ready for layout

---

## 9. What to do next

- Add raster effects:  
  → Photoshop guides

- Assemble boards:  
  → InDesign guides

Illustrator should clarify intent, not decorate.
