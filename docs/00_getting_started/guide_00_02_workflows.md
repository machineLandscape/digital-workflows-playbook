# GUIDE_00_02 — How to Think About Digital Workflows in Studio

**Version:** v01.0  
**Audience:** Mixed ability  
**Last updated:** 2025-12-20  
**Applies to:** All software and all studios  
**Does not cover:** Software-specific commands or tutorials

## 1. What this does

This guide explains **how to think about digital tools as a workflow**, not as isolated software skills.

Its goal is to help you:
- Choose the *right* tool at the right moment
- Avoid redoing work
- Understand why things break when moving between software

---

## 2. When to use this

Use this guide:
- At the start of a project
- When you feel unsure which software to use next
- When work feels inefficient or repetitive
- When you are translating between tools

---

## 3. The core idea (read this)

Digital work in studio follows this pattern:

**Data → Geometry → Drawing → Graphic**

Each stage has a dominant tool.

---

## 4. Tool roles (high level)

| Stage | Primary tool | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Mapping | GIS | Spatial context and data |
| Modeling | Rhino | 3D geometry and terrain |
| Drafting | CAD | Precision and scale |
| Representation | Adobe | Graphic clarity |

Problems happen when tools are used outside their role.

## 5. Common workflow mistakes

**Using Illustrator to draft**  
→ Leads to scale and precision errors

**Using Rhino to annotate**  
→ Creates fragile drawings

**Using Photoshop to fix drafting issues**  
→ Hides, rather than solves, problems

---

## 6. How to decide what to do next

Ask:
1. Do I need **data**? → GIS  
2. Do I need **geometry**? → Rhino  
3. Do I need **measured drawings**? → CAD  
4. Do I need **graphic clarity**? → Illustrator / Photoshop / InDesign  

If you can answer that, you know the next step.

## 7. Checkpoint

You should be able to explain:
- What stage you are in
- What tool you should be using
- What the next translation step will be

---

## 8. What to do next

- Start a project:  
  → [Set Up Project Folders & File Naming](guide_00_01_folders.md)

- Need site information:  
  → [Find and Evaluate Spatial Data (US)](../01_mapping/guide_gis_01_find_data.md)

Understanding workflows saves more time than learning shortcuts.
