## 1. What this playbook is

This is **not a course** and **not a linear tutorial**.

It is a **reference system** for digital work in studio.

## 2. How to use it

- Start where you are stuck
- Use guides independently
- Do not read everything

This mirrors professional practice.

## Workflow Guides vs Technique Guides

Workflow guides explain:
- What you are doing
- When to do it
- What quality looks like

Technique guides explain:
- How to execute a specific task
- Step-by-step commands
- Tool-specific procedures

Use workflow guides first.
Use technique guides only when stuck.
