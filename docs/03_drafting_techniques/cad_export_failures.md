# CAD Technique — Fix Broken PDF Exports

**Use when:** PDFs look wrong, faint, or incomplete.

---

## Diagnose first

- Missing elements → layer visibility
- Faint lines → plot style / lineweights
- Wrong scale → viewport issues

---

## Correct approach

Always fix export problems in CAD, not in Illustrator or Photoshop.

---

## Checklist before exporting

- Viewports locked
- Correct plot style
- Preview before final export

---

## Rule

If the PDF is wrong, the drawing is not finished.
